# Kuttyകളി – Calm Chaos, One Click at a Time 🌿

**Kuttyകളി**is a web playground full of fun little activities —  
~ None of them have any real purpose.
~ This is not a productivity tool.  
~ It’s a **calm corner of the internet** built purely to waste time... beautifully.


Kuttyകളി is a small collection of **useless but oddly calming mini-games**:
It contains:
| 🔢 **Calculator Game** -Makes you guess math symbols instead of calculating cozz  confusion is fun. 
| 🌀 **RandomTxt** -Generates quirky nicknames and random phrases from the text u gave. Especially for those moments when you're bored of your own name. |
| 🌬️ **Breath In** - A simple breathing exercise. Totally not certified... but relaxing. |
| 🍃 **Maram** | Drag leaves onto a tree | It achieves nothing. Yet it's kind of peaceful. |

## 💭 Why This Project?

Because not everything needs a reason.  
Because sometimes, doing things that don’t matter is exactly what your brain needs.  
Because calmness doesn’t always come from silence — it comes from **play**.
